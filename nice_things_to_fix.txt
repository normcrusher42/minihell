fix list is sorted from very minor to minor, mild, concerning, ragebaiting, and fuck my life (lets hope it doesn't get worse than this 🙏)

very minor - env displaying uninitialized vars when it shouldn't ✅
minor - global variable exit status not updating when running into an unclosed quote. ✅
minor - blank newline on unclosed quote (a 3rd error msg can appear that needs its own condition) ✅
minor - export not printing alphabetically as it should ✅
minor - export print still running anyways despite EoF error ✅ (ignore export bug if no time since its a very harmless bug)
concerning - weird quote behavior when trying to expand $" (at the end of the string too) ✅

just what - change the fork error thing in the executor cs it shouldn't be there ❔
