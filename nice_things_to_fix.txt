fix list is sorted from very minor to minor, mild, concerning, ragebaiting, and fuck my life (lets hope it doesn't get worse than this 🙏)

very minor - env displaying uninitialized vars when it shouldn't ✅
very minorish - syntax error never being reached despite having its criteria ✅ WAS NEVER AN ISSUE I JUST DIDNT DO RESEARCH
minor - global variable exit status not updating when running into an unclosed quote. 
minor - blank newline on unclosed quote (a 3rd error msg can appear that needs its own condition) ✅
minor - export not printing alphabetically as it should ✅
minor - export print still running anyways despite EoF error ✅ (ignore export bug if no time since its a very harmless bug)
minor - signal calls in both parent and child cause ctrl + C and \ kinda result in whack behavior (also quit core dump msg jst copy enoshan's approach) ❌
mild - leaks in pipes, possibly exiting before freeing anything ✅
mild - bin functions not depending on PATH which it should incase PATH was unset. ❌
concerning - weird quote behavior when trying to expand $" (at the end of the string too) ✅
ragebaiting - heredoc not expanding envs and unclosed fds and unconditional jumps.. fuck me man passing the quote var gon be like the delicate flower quest from HK ❌

just what - change the fork error thing in the executor cs it shouldn't be there ❔
