fix list is sorted from very minor to minor, mild, concerning, ragebaiting, and fuck my life (lets hope it doesn't get worse than this 🙏)

very minor - fix env displaying uninitialized vars when it shouldn't ✅
minor - fix global variable exit status not updating when running into an unclosed quote. ❌
minor - fix blank newline on unclosed quote (a 3rd error msg can appear that needs its own condition) ❌
minor - fix export not printing alphabetically as it should ✅
concerning - fix weird quote behavior when trying to expand $" (at the end of the string too) and export print still running anyways despite EoF error ❌

just what - change the fork error thing in the executor cs it shouldn't be there ❔
