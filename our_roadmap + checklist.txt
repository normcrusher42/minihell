✅ Adjusted Plan: Work 3–4 Days/Week

    Total Work Weeks: 4 (July 29 – Aug 28)

    Workdays per Week: ~3–4 (approx. 12–16 full days total)

    Strategy: Each session ≈ 4–5 hrs focused coding.

    Pairing Mode: Beans and Pika work mostly in parallel, sync at end of day.

    Theme: Beans → Parsing & Signals, Pika → Execution & Builtins.

✅ WEEKLY ROADMAP (3–4 Days/Week)
✅ Week 1 (July 29 – Aug 4): Project Setup + Basic Loop

Goal: Project skeleton, Makefile, main loop, signal handling.

Workdays: 3 days
Day 1 (Both) ------------------------------ ✅

    Setup Git structure:

    minishell/
    ├── Makefile
    ├── include/minishell.h
    ├── src/
        ├── main.c
        ├── parser.c
        ├── executor.c
        ├── builtins.c
        └── signals.c

    Add Makefile rules: all, clean, fclean, re.

    Initialize libft if needed.
------------------------------------------- ✅
Day 2

    Beans: Implement main loop

        readline("minishell$ ").

        Add to history with add_history().

        Handle EOF (Ctrl+D) → exit shell with cleanup.

    Pika: Start environment handler

        Convert envp → linked list (key=value).

        Implement get_env_value(), set_env_value().
------------------------------------------- ✅
Day 3

    Beans: Signal handling (sigaction).

        Ctrl+C → new prompt.

        Ctrl+D → handled in loop.

        Ctrl+\ → ignore.

        Use one global var for signal status.

    Pika: Test env list & prepare base exec structure.
------------------------------------------- ✅
✅ End of Week 1 Deliverable:

    Project compiles.

    Shell shows prompt, handles Ctrl+C/D/\, and has env list ready.

✅ Week 2 (Aug 5 – Aug 11): Parsing & Env Expansion

Goal: Tokenizer, env expansion, and command structure.

Workdays: 4 days
Day 1

    Beans: Lexer (tokenize input).

        Handle spaces, quotes, operators (|, <, >, <<, >>).

    Pika: Add $VAR and $? expansion support.

        Replace tokens containing $ with their env values.

Day 2

    Beans: Quote handling:

        ' ' → literal text.

        " " → expand $VAR inside.

    Pika: Create command node structure:

    typedef struct s_cmd {
        char **argv;
        int input_fd;
        int output_fd;
        t_redir *redirs;
    } t_cmd;

Day 3

    Build parser:

        Group tokens into commands.

        Detect pipes and redirections.

    Both sync and test:

    echo "hello world"
    ls -l | grep minishell

Day 4

    Validate edge cases:

        Empty input.

        Unclosed quotes.

    Memory cleanup after each command.

✅ End of Week 2 Deliverable:

    Input → tokens → command table with argv, pipes, and redirections parsed.

    Env expansions work.

✅ Week 3 (Aug 12 – Aug 18): Execution Engine + Builtins

Goal: Execute commands (builtins + PATH exec), basic piping.

Workdays: 3–4 days
Day 1

    Pika: Implement exec logic:

        fork(), execve(), waitpid().

        PATH search for external commands.

    Beans: Write builtins skeletons (echo, pwd, exit).

Day 2

    Pika: Integrate env for execve().

    Beans: Implement cd, export, unset, env.

Day 3

    Add builtin detection before forking.

    Handle exit codes properly.

Day 4 (Optional if extra day available)

    Full testing:

    echo hi
    cd ..
    pwd
    env
    exit

✅ End of Week 3 Deliverable:

    All builtins work.

    External commands run with execve.

    Handles exit codes.

✅ Week 4 (Aug 19 – Aug 24): Pipes + Redirections + Heredoc

Goal: Complete all mandatory I/O features.

Workdays: 3–4 days
Day 1

    Beans: Implement pipes (|) with pipe(), dup2().

    Pika: Implement > and >> redirections.

Day 2

    Beans: Support multiple pipes.

    Pika: Add < and << (heredoc).

        Read until delimiter without adding to history.

Day 3

    Integrate pipes + redirections together.

    Handle mixed cases:

    cat file | grep text > out.txt
    echo hi >> log.txt

Day 4

    Stress test and fix bugs:

        Chain pipes + redirects.

        Signals during execution.

✅ End of Week 4 Deliverable:

    Fully functional minishell with all mandatory features.

✅ Final Phase (Aug 25 – Aug 28): Integration + Debugging

Goal: Polish and defense prep.

Workdays: 3 days
Day 1

    Merge final branches → master.

    Remove debug prints.

    Add proper error handling (perror()).

Day 2

    Valgrind session:

        Fix memory leaks (except readline).

    Test with:

        Invalid syntax.

        Mixed quotes.

        $? expansions.

Day 3

    Create defense checklist:

        Builtins, pipes, redirs, signals, env.

    Prepare test cases for peer eval.

✅ By Aug 28:

    Project ready for push.

    All tests passed.

    Clean, Norm-compliant.

✅ Role Summary

    Beans → Parsing, Signals, Pipes.

    Pika → Execution, Builtins, Redirections.

    Both → Integration, Debugging.
